Appointments are scheduled through the BE Comm Lab's online scheduler--thanks [BE Comm Lab](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/be/)!

Make sure you select the coding calendar from the dropdown at the top of the page.

*Appointments are available in person for some fellows, but remote appointments are available for all fellows if you prefer.*

Although we're happy to provide support COMSOL if necessary, please reach out to
[Prerna Bhargava](mailto:bhargavp@mit.edu) to schedule for this software only.

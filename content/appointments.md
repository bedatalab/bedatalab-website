Appointments are scheduled through the BE Comm Lab's online scheduler--thanks [BE Comm Lab](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/be/)!

**Make sure you select the coding calendar from the dropdown at the top of the page.**

*Appointments will be exclusively online until further notice from MIT.*

Although we're happy to provide support COMSOL if necessary, please reach out to
[Prerna Bhargava](mailto:bhargavp@mit.edu) to schedule for this software only.
